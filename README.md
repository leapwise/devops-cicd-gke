# DevOps Engineer Assignment: Building a Scalable CI/CD Pipeline with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

## Background
Welcome to the assignment aimed at designing and implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline integrated with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for a high-traffic web application.

## Requirements

### Infrastructure Setup
- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) and create a repository for the project.
- Choose a suitable CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI) and integrate it with the repository.
- Design the infrastructure leveraging Google Cloud Platform services, especially GKE for container orchestration.
- Establish a Kubernetes cluster on GKE, ensuring scalability and resilience.

### Containerization and Orchestration
- Implement containerization using Docker for the application.
- Define Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for deploying the application onto the GKE cluster.
- Set up autoscaling and load balancing within the cluster to handle varying traffic levels efficiently.

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Integrate the CI/CD tool with GKE for automated deployment of containerized applications.
- Configure pipeline stages for building container images, running tests, and deploying to Kubernetes.
- Implement blue-green deployments or other rollout strategies for seamless updates without downtime.

### Monitoring and Observability
- Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Stackdriver, Prometheus) to gather metrics and logs from the GKE cluster and the deployed application.
- Set up alerts and notifications for performance issues, errors, or anomalies.
- Develop dashboards or visualizations for monitoring the health and performance of the application in the GKE environment.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- Document the entire setup process, including GKE cluster configuration, CI/CD pipeline setup, and Kubernetes deployment strategies.
- Conduct a knowledge-sharing session to demonstrate the functionalities of the integrated system and its benefits to the team.

## Deliverables
- Detailed architecture diagrams showcasing the CI/CD pipeline and GKE integration.
- Configuration files, scripts, or YAML manifests used for setting up the pipeline and deploying to GKE.
- Comprehensive documentation covering setup instructions, guidelines, and troubleshooting steps related to GKE and the CI/CD pipeline.
- Presentation or demonstration highlighting the capabilities of the integrated system and its advantages.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Effectiveness of GKE integration for deploying and managing applications.
- Efficiency of the CI/CD pipeline in automating container builds, testing, and Kubernetes deployment.
- Quality and comprehensiveness of documentation, facilitating easy adoption and troubleshooting.
- Clarity and effectiveness of the knowledge-sharing session.

## Additional Information
Feel free to explore additional Google Cloud Platform services that complement GKE and enhance the CI/CD pipeline's capabilities. Adhering to best practices for Kubernetes and container orchestration is highly encouraged.
